          <p>
            My name is Ariff Salami, I am a 15 year old Web Developer(Student).
            I am very enthusiastic about technology in general, and I love to
            get myself busy, I'm also good at communicating with other people,
            and working in teams. I don't feel enthusiastic for just web
            development, I am aslo interested in a lot of other things.

          <p>
            Futhermore, I dislike being idle, and I prefer to keep myself busy.
            I'm a a fast learner who can do numerous types of jobs. Well, I also
            wanna make sure that my family is happy and healthy, so I have to
            work hard as a man.

            I'm also open-minded, and can maybe provide business strategies to
            support my bossm and boost my workplace. I believe that we can do a
            lot to change the word in a positive way, and over all I'm a regious
            peroson, so I won't do anything indecent or anything that goes
            against my beliefs.

            As I mentioned before I am currently learning software engineering,
            and I built this portfolio myself. I have always had an interest for
            tech, I was even more into it when I built my first proper project
            "<a href="https://big-3-three.vercel.app/" class="big-three"
              >Big Three</a
            >, It looks a little too colorful to me, well it's my first project.
            Let me show you more of my projects."

            <p>Here are some of my projects:</p>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <a href="https://hestaine-novels.vercel.app/"

              These projects, are perosnal projects. I do hope that Hestaine
              novels becomes something though. Well these arent all but you can
